            <h1>Learning the four principles of OOP</h1>

            <h2>
                What is OOP?
            </h2>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
                    It is one of the most popular approaches to solve a programming problem
                    as it makes it easier to represent real life things in code, as Objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Class - </b>To make objects we first need to define them, we use a Class for this.
                    A class is a blueprint for the object. We can think of a class as a sketch of an Object.
                    It contains all of the object details, such as the information about the object known as the class attributes,
                    and the behavior of the object known as the class methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Objects - </b>Once we have a blueprint for an object, we can create the object itself also known as making an instance of the class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Methods - </b>Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class. They are used to define the behaviors of an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with the building blocks of OOP, such as the Class, Objects and Methods already referred to, OOP has four important principles
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Inheritance
            </h2>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    Inheritance is a way of creating a new class by using the details already defined of an existing class.
                    The new class is called the child class, while the class that was used as a base is called a parent class or a base class.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Encapsulation
            </h2>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is the idea of keeping the data of a class to itself and only allowing methods to interact with the class data.
                    This is done by restricting access to the class' methods and variables which prevents data from direct modification.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Polymorphism
            </h2>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    Polymorphism is the ability to use a common interface for multiple classes (data types). This can be explained as
                    an object acting as more than a single class depending on the actions (functions, usage, methods) used on the object.
                    For example, if Class B is a child class of Class A, an we have an instance C of class B, we can
                    both, a function that works only with Class A, and a function that only works with Class B, on C.
                    When doing this, C will act as the class that is needed for each function.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h2>
                Abstraction
            </h2>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides” unnecessary information.
                    The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
                    It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.
